# Citi_Bike_Analysis

#     The bike sharing program hosted in New York City, Citi Bike, is a ride sharing serice allowing patrons to rent a bke at any of their locations and return it to any of their locations when neccessary. This analytical presentation will be a thorough examination of the hypothesized questions posed at the beginning of this study:

What days are busiest/ least busy at Citi Bike?
What hours of the day are most popular for Citi Bike?
Which age groups use Citi Bike most frequently?
Which bike stations are most popular to start and end completed trips at?

Data Source Summary:
     I found this data source on the Kaggle website, which was a reliable and recommended source through Career Foundry Lessons. Kaggle’s retrieval of the data set was actually from the Citi Bike Website, which is a direct link. On the website there are a consistent chronological data values spanning across demographics of information regarding every single archive they have in reference to Citi Bike’s monthly trip data. The data is suitable to be alleged as reliable for a source, as it is from Kaggle—recommended by this school. I do not see a ton of variation in the information from the first look but managed to change several components of the data to make it more useful. Additionally, the data is relatively easy to digest because it is laid out in such a format that we are getting individual usage data alongside administrative access to data. This means I can see how long rides took, timing of rides, locations, and many bits of information regarding clients—per a direct link to their application information. Misuse of the application (inaccurate age or even a different person) could potentially lead to information inaccuracies that would be quite hard to test against.
